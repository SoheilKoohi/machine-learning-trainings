implementation of machine learning algorithms:

'RLS.py'---->
Contains the three algorithm for implementation of online parameter estimation of linear model. and comparison of these algorithms in the mean square error sense.
the algorithms are : Affine Projection Algorithm (APA) , Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) and Recursive Least Square (RLS)
